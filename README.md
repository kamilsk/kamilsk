- A micro-entrepreneur and founder of [OctoLab][].
- A creator of [LifeOS][], [Sparkle][], and [Tact][].
- An open-source enthusiast and [mentor][GetMentor].

As a founder, my dream has always been to balance cherishing moments
with my family and achieve substantial success professionally.
This vision led me to conceive [LifeOS][], a system designed to navigate
the complexities of modern life. By creating two products, [Sparkle][] and
[Tact][], I‚Äôve aimed to encapsulate the essence of efficiency and
knowledge management. These tools are my commitment to elevating my life and
empowering others to do the same, fostering a community where work and
personal life can flourish.
