  # What is the Tech Radar?

  My personal Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment
  result, called ring assignment. I use four rings with the following semantics:
    ADOPT — Technologies I have high confidence in to serve my purpose,
      also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in my
      production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.
    TRIAL — Technologies that I have seen work with success in project work
      to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm
      benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly
      more risky.
    ASSESS — Technologies that are promising and have clear potential
      value-add for me; technologies worth to invest some research and
      prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies
      have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven
      in my experience.
    HOLD — Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects.
      Technologies that I think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in.
      HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually
      can be continued for existing projects.

  # What is the purpose?

  The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support by me to pick the best
  technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge
  and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and
  continuously evolve my technology landscape. Based on the pioneering work
  of ThoughtWorks, my Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that
  are interesting in software development — changes that I think should
  pay attention to and use in my projects.

  # How do I maintain it?

  Coming soon I will describe how I do that. Stay tuned!
